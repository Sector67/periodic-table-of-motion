- Cell Title: Gear Ratio - Little to Big
- Description: When the driving gear is smaller, for every time it spins one revolution the large gear spins a fraction of a turn.
- Benefits: A fast but weak motor can drive very heavy loads with this type of gear because it trades speed for torque and very precise motion to a fraction of a degree. With the right ratios a motor spinning at a constant speed can spin one gear that does one revolution per minute, another that does one revolution per hour, and a third that does one revolution every 12 hours.
- Used in: Clocks, vehicles.
