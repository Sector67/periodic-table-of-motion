- Cell Title: Pulley
- Description: One of the simple machines. A free wheel translates force on a rope from one direction to another.
- Benefits: The pulley allows a force to be applied in a more convenient way, like lifting an object while staying stationary. When combined with a motor, the motor can spin a drum to collect the rope while it lifts or pulls the object.
- Used in: Elevators, cranes, and even window blinds benefit from pulleys.
